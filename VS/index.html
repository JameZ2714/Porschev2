                <h2>What Does the Name Mean?</h2>
                <p>So, what does “Porsche” mean? It’s actually the surname of the company’s founder, Ferdinand Porsche. Initially, Porsche started as an engineering consulting firm geared towards the automotive industry. It was years before Porsche would start creating vehicles under their own name, with Ferdinand first lending his talents to create other memorable models like the Volkswagen Beetle. In 1948, the first vehicle to officially carry the Porsche name and logo was built. Dubbed the Porsche 356, echoes of this first Porsche can still be found in the styling and design of modern Porsche vehicles.</p>
            
                <h2>What is the Full Porsche Company Name?</h2>
                <p>While you may have thought Porsche was the company’s full name, it isn’t. It’s actually Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG. While that may seem like an unusual name for a company known for creating racing cars, the Porsche meaning makes sense when you discover it is the founder’s full name and title.</p>


                <h2>What is the Full Porsche Company Name?</h2>
                <p>The “Dr.” in the beginning naturally stands for “doctor.” The less commonly known “Ing. h.c.” stands for “Ingenieur honoris causa.” Translated into English, it means “Engineer honorary degree.” The following “F.” is for the founder’s first name: Ferdinand. Combine it all, and in English, you have Doctor of Engineering Honorary Degree Ferdinand Porsche. The “AG” tacked on at the end is simply refers to the type of company it is, in the same way as “LLC” or “Corp.” do. AG stands for “Aktiengesellschaft,” which translates to “shares company.” Basically, it means the company is owned by shareholders.</p>
